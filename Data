These are the sights that I gathered data from:
1) Firearm Mortality by states
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm
2) US number of registerd Firearms
https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/guns-per-capita
3) Number of Mass Shootings in US
https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/mass-shootings-by-state

I wanted to find data on individuals that carry concealed weapons, but I could not find a good data source for that.
