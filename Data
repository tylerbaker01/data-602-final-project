These are the sights that I gathered data from:
1) Firearm Mortality by states
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm
2) US number of registerd Firearms
https://www.statista.com/statistics/215655/number-of-registered-weapons-in-the-us-by-state/
3) Number of Mass Shootings in US
https://www.statista.com/statistics/811487/number-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us/

I wanted to find data on individuals that carry concealed weapons, but I could not find a good data source for that.
