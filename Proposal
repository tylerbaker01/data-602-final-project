Research Question:
Does gun ownership directly lead to more gun violence?
Justification:
This is relevent to anyone who lives in the United States (since that will be the data I am looking at) because gun violence is a serious problem that causes severe societal problems.
Data Sources:
I will use four data sources.
A) Number of registered firearms per state of 2021.

B) Concealed carry permits by states from 2021.

C) Firearm mortality rate by states from 2020. I know that stats on 2021 would be more accurate, 
but I do not believe there are stats available for the year yet. For the sake of this paper, I will assume that 2020's stats are nearly identical to last year's.

D) Mass shootings from 2021.
